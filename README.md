# Home Gallery
## Description
A simple interactive gallery for viewing information about homes.

Built from a basic, compact UI kickstart that includes:

* Webpack
* Babel
* The latest JavaScript + Stage 2
* ESLint
* React.js

## Installation
Clone this repository, switch to that directory, then run:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

You should then be able to browse `localhost:3000`

## Project Roadmap
* Debug the project.
* Make the gallery interactive, so that clicking on a thumbnail of a home displays a dialog with more details.
* Bonus: Make the gallery responsive to the size of the user's browser.
